What we have completed: 
-	All requirements while maintaining a minimalistic image on the webpage as it is the new trend in webpages
-	A color palette of soft shades (white, black, grey)
-	All graphics on this assignment that incorporate text and images have been designed by us
-	Complete navigation between pages
-	Static logo located on the top acts as our “banner” for pages that do not have a banner, such as “The Zodiac Collection” page. Other pages, “Home” and “Contact Us” have its own specialized banner that acts as a title for the page. 
-	A complete form that submits all 6 fields to http://php.vncvr.ca/zodiac/ 
-	Best practices were used including: Github, Scrum and Jira Agile Development

What we have not completed: 
-	Putting the same banner on every page
-	Padding tags we could have put here and there to make the website more aesthetically pleasing to the eye

Major Challenges included: 
-	Identifying what flagged the validator error
-	Fixing the validator errors
-	Float and alignment for <div> sections of text
-	Flagged by the validator for putting a <table> in a <form> and figuring out that the correct method is putting a <form> in a <table>
-	Submitting the fields to the .php site, we think Medhat could have helped us in his lecture a little more 
-	Not reading the instructions carefully and doing things over again (that’s on us)
